<h2>👩‍💻About me</h2>

Hi, I'm Diego. A computer and programming enthusiast 💻, I am currently learning about HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript, GIT and GitHub. Tools that little by little I am implementing for my projects, soon I will be uploading more repositories, I hope you are doing well and see you.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
